# pathfinder-algorithm-implementation
I created a game which utilizes the A* algorithm to find the shortest distance between two points of the user's choosing on a grid.
If you want to run this program, download pygames to your pc through command shell or equivalent with the command "pip install pygame".
To start, pick one spot on the grid as your starting position with a left click and then pick another spot as the end position with a right click. 
Next, your can click as many positions on the screen to set up barriers after setting up the start and end position. Addtionally, you can left click any
square on the grid to remove the start, stop, or barrier block and you can reinput them by clicking a new position on the grid. 
The key c will restart the grid. The space key will run the program after you have picked a start and stop point.
